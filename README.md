# School-Based-Optimization-SBO
SBO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the traditional educational process that operates within a multi-classroom school. SBO is a collaborative optimization strategy, which allows for extensive exploration of the search space and results in high-quality solutions. More details about this algorithm and other similar algorithms could be find in the following papers:
